Cross platform mobile platform which parses HTML to create native user interface. The css version will be lite version of the current css implementation. 

The backend is expected to be javascript with interface to adobe mobile plugins. This will eliminate the browser completely and hence performance will be expected to supreme. Ultimately the lite weight engine will be implemented in other platforms to make the framework cross platform application.

The project is in POC state.
